# Cmajor Licensing

## Different Cmajor licensing options

Cmajor is available under a dual GPLv3/Commercial licensing scheme.

**If you fully comply with the terms of the [GPLv3 (or later)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) then you can use Cmajor without needing to contact us.**

### Commercial License terms

If you'd like to embed the Cmajor engine in a closed-source product, or to mix it with non-GPL-compliant code, then we offer commercial licenses to cover many types of use-case (and can discuss any custom requirements you may have).

Please visit our [website](https://cmajor.dev/docs/Licence) for more information about purchasing a commercial license.
